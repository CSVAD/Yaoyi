The idea of this pattern come from a book I recently read about traditional Chinese folk clothing patterns. Flower is a typical pattern that is often seen and used, which also has the meaning of beauty and good fortune. Traditional Chinese embroidery is rich of repetition, and studying this those patterns is one of my interests. 

Creating those wallpapers are generally repeating a basic pattern. The basic pattern is:

Those images are based on the same pattern, but with some slightly color balance, brightness and saturation changes. 

First, we calculate the repeating pattern of the first and last several rows. And then, we calculate the repeating pattern of the first and last several columns. The some columns should not overlap with those rows that has already painted. Also, there are 3 layers of patterns. All of them are generated with the same function, so it is crucial to make the generating function feasible for all 3 layers. Therefore the input of the function should be based on various kinds of situations. When we change the parameters of those functions, there will be different results, as shown in the folder.
