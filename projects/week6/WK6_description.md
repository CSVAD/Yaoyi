The idea this week is very straight forward, is using the combination of RGB colors to attain other colors. Since in computers, the colors are not designed to be illustrated by light waves. The RGB colors are a kind of expressive way to realize color display on screen. The three knobs are the controller of color input. And the linear combination of values gained from knobs will control the input and ratio of each color. 

In my opinion, this project is very computer graphics. Since the color is directly RGB, it is very easy to understand. But I think it is not that artistic in terms of art and design. So I think it might be easy for people from computer science to use, but maybe not that easy for other people to use. So I feel that I do not like my design this time.
