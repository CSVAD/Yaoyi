#  WK4 description

The idea this week comes from generating bubbles under water using LSystem. 

The LSystem code reference is [here](https://processing.org/examples/pentigree.html).

And I have three result images:

The bubbles are generated based on LSystem algorithm and have randomness on the length and the size of rotation between each bubble. The results are not too random because the LSystem algorithm and Perlin noise constrain the step by step generation. The idea of this work is simply generating circles from some point on the panel and gradually generate the pattern step by step.
