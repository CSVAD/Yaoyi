## Since I have some Github problem with the uploading the whole Eclipse project, I only uploaded the results, which contains the code I wrote and two examples. I am sorry about the inconvenience. 

The idea this week is a simple modification of what I have done in week2: the insetting problem.

The goal is to simply help people to inset image pattern on the size of panel they defined themselves. The user can import their own image and their own panel size, as well as the image display pattern. 

The users are provided with several setup functions to use, then the system will automatically calculate how to do the insetting for the image the users predefined. If the RectPaint() function is called, the system will automatically paint based on all the information user have pre-defined. So the key terminology would be RectPaint() function. It is a simple calculation based on the size of image and panel. It can also be universally used in different situations.
