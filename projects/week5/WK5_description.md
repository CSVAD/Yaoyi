The idea this week comes from flower falling effect, which is considered romantic in Chinese culture whereas sad in Japanese culture. The pink color can be viewed as cherry blossom flowers. Patels are preloaded images. The painting pattern are generated every 3 frames so that the patels will be aggregate together. Also, Perlin noise is applied to decide the rotation degree and the size of the patels. So there will be more differences. Also, there are repeatitions so that every time users can create multiple patels at the same time. And this is the very simple version of introduction of this project.
