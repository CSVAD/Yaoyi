# WK 5 Reflection: Dynamic Art and Design

## Stop Drawing Dead Fish
I would agree with that video games are indeed attractive. Since I am doing research about video games engine myself, I cannot deny the tremendous power of video games. But before the emergence of video games, there have been numerous games. Like card games, sports and all kinds of interactive games that we have played when we were young. In my opinion, the biggest advantage computers have as an art medium is the fact that it is capable of providing unlimited possibility. Video games enables a totally virtual world. People enjoys the virtual world because it provides elements that does not exist in the real world. We are switching from our real life into something totally different. So I think video game here is not a good analogy. But I am still looking forward to see what will be the future of interactive painting as well as the future trend of games and movies. There are numerous possibilities that will emerge from current technology development. So I am optimistic about it. 


## Dynamic Pictures
I feel excited that the pictures in the future will be dynamic. But I would believe that dynamic images will not replace static images. I agree that technologies will improve the interaction between art and audience, but it does not mean interaction and dynamic relation will always be more attractive. We can simply compare the paintings in museums with dynamic pictures. 
Though paintings are static, it provides more imagination possibility to audiences. People can walk around portrait while the figure is actually watching the audiences purely by artistsâ€™ painting skills. People can also imagine the wind, sunlight, heat or wave that go in all directions by imagining. On the contrary, dynamic images may to some extent shrink the space of imagination. Since those interactions and imaginations are constrained in a pre-defined space. So I feel that dynamic pictures will fully replaced static images.
