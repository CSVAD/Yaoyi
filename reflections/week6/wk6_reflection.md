# WK 6 Reflection: Interface

## User Interface: A Personal View 

I would say every time I have ever started using any application on computer I would start from using user interface rather than terminal. It is natural for me to think that all applications were created with interface. It seems too obvious for me and I have never thought about using terminal until I became a computer science student and professors required us to use terminals. So it is a huge step forward for humans to have graphics interface and have this idea about graphics interface. It enables users without knowledge to use computer OS and applications, and this enables to widespread of computers as a tool in daily life. This is revolutionary. Also, the revolving of icons and computer space images are also great. It can be viewed as an abstraction of ideas, and this encourages the evolution of new ideas and thus new abstractions. So I think it is a circulation of revolution. 

## Instrumental Interaction: An Interaction Model for Designing Post-WlMP User Interfaces 

Since it is a 200 paper, I think it is amazing to see people were thinking about using computers to implement an interface for human and instrument interaction. Since this paper describes how to combine interaction techniques in a meaningful and consistent way and defines the "look and feel" of the interaction from the user's perspective, I think it is also revolutionary. Although it seems that it has not implemented the idea into a real product, the ideas in this paper is new and innovative.

## Alternative Programming Interfaces for Alternative Programmers

It would be indeed interesting to see the author categorized interfaces into three kinds. The physical, conceptual and social. I used to focus more on the first two, but I have not paid any attention on the last one. Since interfaces are aimed at providing more convenient ways for users especially those who are not familiar with computers, it would be extremely important to understand and design based on the need of customer. So I think it is a very interesting paper to study those components of interfaces and so-called “Alternative Programming Interfaces”.
