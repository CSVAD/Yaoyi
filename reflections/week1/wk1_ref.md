### Cybernetics, art and ideas

When talking about the relationship between computer technology and art, the first idea that comes to my mind is not the classification of cyberarts or how computers are capable of improving art and design. I will always ask myself, how can I use those knowledge about computer science or computer graphics into the field of art and design? Computer graphics technology are widely used in movies, animations and games. Those applications can be catagorized as visual art. Different from traditional art, CG art enables higher possibility. Researchers, engineers and artists work together to bring the rules in the real world into a virtual world. It is not the world "the terminals for picture making are still very limited in possibilities of variation" as mentioned in the essay any more. Now the new question is, how can we use those technology well?

I have conducted research as well as AR implementation about applying this latest technology to museum galleries. I found out that this new technology is too far from the public, they do not have a clear idea about what does AR do? Nether do I. I was also doing experiments on whether I should play videos beside the status or whether I should make the status or paintings talk to the audience. Even if they can, the next question would be whether it is meaningful to implement these features. Because the interaction between human and computer is crucial, I believe that more features and more possibilities will be generated.

However, similar to the fact that books and paintings are capable of carrying culture with them and spread  to the whole world, using data to describe them would be even easier than books and paintings. So I believe that computer technology will be indispensable to art and design in the future.
