### Cybernetics, art and ideas

When talking about the relationship between computer technology and art, the first idea that comes to my mind is not the classification of cyberarts or how computers are capable of improving art and design. I will always ask myself, how can I use those knowledge about computer science or computer graphics into the field of art and design? Computer graphics technology are widely used in movies, animations and games. Those applications can be catagorized as visual art. Different from traditional art, CG art enables higher possibility. Researchers, engineers and artists work together to bring the rules in the real world into a virtual world. It is not the world "the terminals for picture making are still very limited in possibilities of variation" as mentioned in the essay any more. Now the new question is, how can we use those technology well?

I have conducted research as well as AR implementation about applying this latest technology to museum galleries. I found out that this new technology is too far from the public, they do not have a clear idea about what does AR do? Nether do I. I was also doing experiments on whether I should play videos beside the status or whether I should make the status or paintings talk to the audience. Even if they can, the next question would be whether it is meaningful to implement these features. Because the interaction between human and computer is crucial, I believe that more features and more possibilities will be generated.

However, similar to the fact that books and paintings are capable of carrying culture with them and spread  to the whole world, using data to describe them would be even easier than books and paintings. So I believe that computer technology will be indispensable to art and design in the future.  

### 4 Symbols

#### Notes

In symbols we have the ultimate tools of abstraction.

Symbolic structures apply the principles of formal reasoning to many more kinds of operands. 

Any markings made for explicit purpose of representation record keeping, or transmittal could be understood as notation.

Today we might say that programming language differs from natural language mainly in its basis for sematics, that is, in the umambiguously declared meanings of words. (I would say mostly true, perhaps.)

According to Goodman, a symbol system is the correspondence by which meanings comply with characters in a symbol scheme. 

The most elegant instances of formal notation occurs in music.( Strongly agree. ）

We lack any real definition of what constitutes a work painting.

The work of craft is neither the design nor the individual artifact: it is the tradition of very production. It is the presence of many objects identical in their conception, and interchangeable in their use, but unique in their execution.

The nature of notation might invite us to employ iterations and conditionals, which together with variables and their relations would turn scripts and scores into true programs.

The basic idea behind object orientation is to provide a single identity for any arbitrary set of properties and capacities.

Abstract data types have been a big advance, because like Vieta’s alphabetic symbols, they allow semantic ideas to be manipulated independently of their actual compliants.

All languages can be studied in terms of formal structure. ( Maybe. But I would say this is not the case for natural languages.)

Does it  suggest that creative computation overcome the traditional separation between tool users and symbol users?
(I would say no. Creation through symbols or symbolic ways like computer generated will not be the same with traditional creation. I think they are totally different styles of art and creation.)
