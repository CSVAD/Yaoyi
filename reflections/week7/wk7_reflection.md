# WK 7 Reflection: Abstraction

## Some Reflections on Designing Construction Kits for Kids 

I agree with most of the ideas in this paper, but I do not fully agree with the idea that says: “Give People What They Want – Not What They Ask For”. Maybe because of the difference of designing tools for children and adults. Since in my opinion, developers should not guess what do users need. On the contrary, they should focus on users’ needs. And I believe this is how people working on marketing are paying attention to. But I agree that this will sometimes result in the disagreement between developer and users because of different point of view people are standing on. So, for designing tools for children, I am not totally sure whether people should focus more on learning needs from children or imagining the need from children.  

## Learnable Programming

I think this is very intuitive for learning programming. I agree that it should be an amazing tool for people without coding skill to get started with using code to perform coding. But I also noticed that the examples are all involved with drawing and pattern creating. Though it is very intuitive for me, I think there are still limitations in this tool. Though I can see the logic flows of creating new shapes and images, I do not see any other examples other than images and patterns. But I believe this would be an amazing future work if “Make Flow Visible” can be extended to making other algorithm visible. Like data flow algorithms or light transport algorithm from graphics. So I think this work is great. Though it contains limitation, but it contains huge possibility.

## Extending Manual Drawing Practices with Artist-Centric Programming Tools

I really like the fact that this novel programming language treats manual drawing inputs as first-class primitives. Since I always feel that the limitation of using computer programming to create art is the fact of input restriction. Most of the time, hand-drawing cannot be used as the inputs of programming languages, whereas they tend to take pure data for simplicity and easier modification. So I feel like it is amazing to see this work that combines procedural and manual art, and allow computer programming as an optimization opportunity to improve manual art design. When it comes to procedural art, I always think of using math and coding to create LSystem or similar patterns in fragment shader. But it turns out that there are more possibilities for what “procedural” should be.
